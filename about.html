I am a logophile. I adore words and what one can do with them. Words can change an opinion, win an argument, sell a widget, but most importantly words are the gateway to knowledge. Words can stop global warming, slow or eliminate the spread of diseases, words can inspire the person who cures cancer or sets foot on Mars.

In my free time I like to travel recently I went to London and Iceland. I enjoy all things tech, reading memoirs, practicing yoga, running and baking gourmet cupcakes.

I love to learn new things, I am currently interested in learning to code, the impact of technology on our society, machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and solar energy.
